Lecture 3 - 2025-02-25 - 1.5h
-----------------------------

* A model of how threads are implemented.
    ** Multiple processors using shared memory.
    ** Thread shared memory areas and thread exclusive memory areas.
    ** The concept of context and of context switch.
    ** Time multiplexing of M threads on N processors, when M is greater than N.

* The _uthreads_ user-space multithreading system.
    ** Thread data structures - stack and descriptor.
    ** Suspending and resuming _uthreads_ - the `context_switch` function.

Lecture 4 - 2025-02-28 - 3.0h
-----------------------------

* The _uthreads_ user-space multithreading system (continuation)
    ** Creating and terminating _uthreads_.
    ** The _uthreads_ system data structures, namely the ready queue.
    ** The _uthreads_ scheduling function.

* Adding control synchronization to the _uthreads_ system.
    ** Busy-waiting vs non-busy waiting.
    ** Adding a list of _joiners_ to each thread descriptor.
    ** Kernel-style (execution delegation).

* Adding I/O based control synchronization to the _uthreads_ system.
    ** Socket operations in the Linux Operating System.
    ** Non-blocking operation mode and the _epoll_ API.
    ** Changing the _uthreads_ system to support non-busy I/O control synchronization using _epoll_.

* Exercises

Lecture 5 - 2025-03-07 - 3.0h
-----------------------------

* Data synchronization on mutable shared state
    ** Mutual exclusion and locks.
        ** The lock acquisition/lock and release/unlock protocol.
    ** Locks in the JVM.
        *** The link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html[`Lock` interface] and the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html[`ReentrantLock` class].
        *** The link:https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.concurrent/with-lock.html[`withLock` Kotlin function].
    ** Using the `class` mechanism to encapsulate the state protected by locks.
    ** Justification for the reentrancy support.
    ** Common errors when using locks.

* Exercises on data synchronization.
    ** Test showing the consequences of non-synchronized concurrent mutation on a list.
    ** Running the same test on a list obtained via `Collections.synchronizedList`, and inspecting its implementation.
    ** Running the same test with explicit lock usage.
